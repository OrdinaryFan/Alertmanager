{-| A note about the `backspacePressed` attribute:

Holding down the backspace removes (one by one) each last character in the input,
and the whole time sends multiple keyDown events. This is a guard so that if a user
holds down backspace to remove the text in the input, they won't accidentally hold
backspace too long and then delete the preceding matcher as well. So, once a user holds
backspace to clear an input, they have to then lift up the key and press it again to
proceed to deleting the next matcher.
